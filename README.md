# 2016-2017L2K1
First real project at my second year at University, using Python.

This project was my first project, cooperating with four other students of the same University.
We had to creat a 3D model of someone walking, and making a video of what he was seeing, puting dots to the locations he was watching while walking. We were using Codamotions and EyeTracking to get the datas for this project.
We had a limited time of 5 weeks to develop the application.
